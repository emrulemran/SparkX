I was quite confident about the .NET bindings since it was extremely easy
to get them working on my laptop.
I admit I got nervous about how it would work on Non-Windows platforms
since it was my first time writing .NET code on a platform that isn't windows.
I shouldn't have been nervous. It was fairly easy to install Mono and MonoDevelop on my Ubuntu VM and
ran the NUnit tests that we have. Google Chrome started and we had tests passing.
Brillant because there was little code changes,
I just updated the code where to find the Google Chrome application.
